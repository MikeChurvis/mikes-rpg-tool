# RPG Tracker Tool

A tool for tracking the many components of tabletop roleplaying games (TTRPGs).

Initially this project will be tailored to the TTRPGs I'm playing now. In ascending order of complexity, these are...
- Monster of the Week
- Monsterpunk
- Exalted

### Why Am I Building This?

1. I need a single source of truth for the characters I play.
1. I need an app that can track, change, and present dozens of arbitrary data.
1. I want to learn new stuff.

Roll20 and Google Drive apps aren't good enough.
- Google Docs is a bad fit for tabular data, and its layout is too linear to give a comprehensive overview.
- Google Sheets is ugly, unspecialized, and tends to break when anything is moved around. It's also a bad fit for non-tabular data.
- Roll20 attribute data is a pain to set up and the values are poorly presented. It also loads slowly and doesn't support the same games we play.

This project is also my excuse to dive into:
- Svelte
- Nanostores
- Tailwind
